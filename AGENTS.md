## What this project is

A **tutorial** C++ example that implements the BACnet **B-ASC (Application Specific Controller)**
device profile using the CAS BACnet Stack. It is one of a series - one git repo
per BACnet profile - and builds on the B-SA (Smart Actuator) example by adding
DeviceCommunicationControl (DM-DCC-B). The top priority is that the code reads
like a tutorial a customer can learn from and copy-paste. Favour clarity over
cleverness.

## Layout

This repository is self-contained:

- `main.cpp` - the example device.
- `common/` - the shared helper, vendored in-repo (not referenced via a path
  outside the repository).
- `submodules/cas-bacnet-stack/` - the **CAS BACnet Stack** as a git submodule
  (private). After cloning, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

## Build

This example links the CAS BACnet Stack as a prebuilt **STATIC** library - build
the library once from the pinned submodule commit, then configure and build:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive   # once, if not cloned with --recursive
tools/build-stack-static.sh BACnetProfileExample-B-ASC-CPP   # from the series root
cmake -B build -S . -DCAS_BACNET_STACK_LINK=STATIC
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The stack library build compiles the whole stack (~600 files) once and takes a
few minutes; the example itself then builds in seconds, and later incremental
rebuilds are fast. Use `-D CAS_STACK_DIR=...` only if your stack lives outside
the bundled submodule. The adapter also offers a SOURCE mode (compiles the
stack straight into the executable, no library build); this example builds and
ships STATIC only.

## Run

```bash
./build/BACnetExampleBASC [--port 47808] [--deviceID 389003]   # Linux/macOS
.\build\Release\BACnetExampleBASC.exe [--port 47808] [--deviceID 389003]   # Windows
```

Interactive keys while running: `h` help, `q` quit, up/down nudge Analog Input 1.

## Conventions

- Device is named "Rainbow"; objects use the series' colour names; vendor id 389.
- Implement **only** the services and objects the B-ASC profile requires - but
  expose **every required property** of each object for Protocol_Revision 24.
- Outputs are **commandable**: store the 16-slot `Priority_Array` +
  `Relinquish_Default` in the app (the `Commandable` struct); let the stack
  resolve `Present_Value`. Writes land via the `SetProperty*` callbacks (value)
  and `SetPropertyNull` (relinquish).
- DeviceCommunicationControl (DM-DCC-B): the stack runs the enable/disable state
  machine; the `DeviceCommunicationControl` callback just validates `DCC_PASSWORD`
  and logs. The deprecated plain `disable` (1) is rejected by the stack at
  Protocol_Revision >= 20 - only `enable` (0) and `disable-initiation` (2) apply.
  This callback has no fallback error code: it must set `*errorCode` on every
  `false` return.
- Every `GetProperty*` callback ends with `uint32_t* errorCode`. Leave it alone
  on a catch-all decline (the stack's decline-and-fabricate default answers
  required properties this app does not serve); set it only where this device
  knows the read is wrong (`State_Text` out of range is the one case here).
- Match the surrounding code style: `const`-correct parameters, check every stack
  return value, keep `main.cpp` linear and well-commented.
- **Never edit `common/` in this repo alone** - it is a vendored copy shared by
  every example in the series, with its own version (`COMMON_VERSION`) and
  changelog (`common/CHANGELOG.md`). To change it: edit, bump the version, add
  a changelog entry, then re-copy `common/` into every example repository.

## How to verify a change

There are no unit tests; verification is behavioural:

1. Build, then run one instance on a clear UDP port.
2. With a BACnet client (e.g. the CAS BACnet Explorer), send **Who-Is** and
   confirm **I-Am** from the device instance.
3. **ReadProperty** every required property of every object and confirm the
   values; confirm `Protocol_Revision` is 24 and `Object_List` lists all objects.
4. **WriteProperty** a commandable output's `Present_Value` at a priority, re-read
   it (and its `Priority_Array`), then write NULL to relinquish and confirm it
   falls back to `Relinquish_Default`. Confirm a write to a read-only input is
   rejected.
5. **DeviceCommunicationControl**: confirm `disable-initiation` and `enable`
   SimpleACK, the deprecated `disable` is rejected (service-request-denied), and a
   wrong password (if `DCC_PASSWORD` is set) is rejected (password-failure).

## Releasing

Bump `APP_VERSION` in `main.cpp` and add an entry to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md),
then tag `vX.Y.Z`. The GitHub Actions workflow builds and publishes the release.

## License

The example source code is dedicated to the public domain under
[CC0-1.0](LICENSE). The CAS BACnet Stack is a separate, commercially licensed
product and is not covered by that dedication.
